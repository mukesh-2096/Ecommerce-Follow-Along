# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Overview
The Ecommerce-Follow-Along project is a hands-on learning experience designed to guide you through the process of building a full-fledged e-commerce application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project aims to provide practical experience with real-world development concepts and tools.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Milestone 1: Project Overview
In this milestone, you will:
- Understand the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learn the foundational steps of setting up a new project.
- Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.
- Prepare for upcoming milestones by setting up the project repository.


## Milestone 2: Login Page Layout Added
In this milestone, we have successfully added the layout for the Login Page. This includes the following key features:
- **User Interface Design**: The Login Page has been designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices for optimal usability.
- **Form Elements**: The Login Page includes essential form elements such as input fields for email and password, and a submit button.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS has been used to style the Login Page, providing a modern and consistent look and feel.

#### Key Components
- **Header**: A welcoming header that introduces the Login Page.
- **Input Fields**: Fields for users to enter their email and password.
- **Submit Button**: A button for users to submit their login credentials.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling to inform users of any issues with their input.


## Milestone 3: Backend Added

In this milestone, we have successfully added the backend for our e-commerce application. This includes the following key features:

### Key Features:
- **API Endpoints**: Implemented several API endpoints for handling user authentication, product management, and order processing.
- **Database Integration**: Integrated MongoDB to store and retrieve data, ensuring a seamless connection between the frontend and backend.
- **Authentication**: Added user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure user data and restrict access to certain endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling to provide informative responses and ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Middleware**: Used middleware to handle tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, and managing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

This milestone lays the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application, providing essential functionality to support user interactions and data management. We will continue to build on this foundation in upcoming milestones to enhance the features and improve the user experience.


## Milestone 4: Backend Enhancements
In this milestone, we made several important updates to our e-commerce application. Here's a summary of what we did:

### Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯
By the end of this milestone, we accomplished the following:
1. **Created a User Model**: This is like a blueprint for how we store user data, such as name, email, and password, in the database.
2. **Created a User Controller**: This part of the server manages user data. It handles actions like adding a new user or getting user information.
3. **Enabled File Uploads with Multer**: Multer is a tool that helps our app accept and store files (like profile pictures) uploaded by users.

### 1. Whatâ€™s a Model?
A model is like a detailed map or plan. When we create a User Model, we're designing how a userâ€™s data will look in the database. Think of it like drawing a blueprint for a house. The model defines what information we need to store for each user.

### 2. Whatâ€™s a Controller?
A controller is a part of the server that manages what happens when someone interacts with our app. For example, if someone wants to sign up, the controller handles the data sent to the server. Think of the controller as a "manager" of requests and responses, making sure everything goes smoothly.

### 3. File Uploads with Multer
Sometimes, users want to upload files like profile pictures. Multer is a tool that makes it easy to upload files to our server. It helps us store user images in the backend, like a virtual file cabinet for storing pictures.


## Milestone 5: Signup Page Added

In this milestone, we have successfully added the Signup page to our e-commerce application. This includes the following key features:
- **User Registration Form**: A form that allows new users to register by providing their name, email, password, and profile picture.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented validation for the name, email, and password fields to ensure data integrity and provide feedback to the user.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Added an eye icon that allows users to toggle the visibility of the password field for convenience.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload a profile picture during registration. The image is displayed as a preview before submission.
- **Form Submission**: On successful validation, the form data is submitted to the server using Axios. The server processes the registration request and stores the user data in the database.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling to inform users of any issues with their input.
